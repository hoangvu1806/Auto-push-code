# Speech Recognition Project

## Overview
This project is a Speech Recognition system built using Python, [Librosa](https://librosa.org/doc/main/) for audio processing, and a neural network model for speech recognition. The goal of the project is to recognize spoken words or phrases from audio data.

## Features
- Utilizes Librosa for audio processing and feature extraction.
- Implements a neural network model for speech recognition.
- Supports training on custom datasets.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for testing the recognition system.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Setup
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/speech-recognition-project.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd speech-recognition-project`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Train the model on your custom dataset:
   ```bash
   python train.py --data_path /path/to/your/dataset
